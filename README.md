Mechanica Binder
=================

Welcome to the Mechanica Binder repository! 
This repository contains the source and supporting 
infrastructure for availability of Mechanica on 
[Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 
All source is taken from the 
[Mechanica project repository](https://github.com/tjsego/mechanica). 

About Mechanica
----------------

Mechanica is an interactive, particle-based physics, chemistry and biology
modeling and simulation environment. Mechanica provides the ability to create, 
simulate and explore models, simulations and virtual experiments of soft condensed 
matter physics at mulitple scales using a simple, intuitive interface. Mechanica 
is designed with an emphasis on problems in complex subcellular, cellular and tissue 
biophysics. Mechanica enables interactive work with simulations on heterogeneous 
computing architectures, where models and simulations can be built and interacted 
with in real-time during execution of a simulation, and computations can be 
selectively offloaded onto available GPUs on-the-fly. 
Mechanica is part of the 
[Tellurium](<http://tellurium.analogmachine.org>) project.
